This simple Python program performs two basic number-related tasks:

1. **Check if a number is even or odd**
2. **Calculate the sum of integers from 1 to 50 using a loop**

## Features

### ✅ Even or Odd Checker
- Prompts the user to enter an integer.
- Determines whether the entered number is even or odd.

### ➕ Sum of Integers from 1 to 50
- Uses a `for` loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 50.
- Adds each number to a running total.
- Prints the final sum (`1275`).
